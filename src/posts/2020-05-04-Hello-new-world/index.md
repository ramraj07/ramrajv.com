excerpt: My effort to start a new website! With its own blog! Thanks Noah Yamamoto!

As it is the case with most of us in this most
 interesting of times, I have a lot of time in
my hand. Hence, I finally managed to muster the effort 
 and put this site together. The final push was when I
 and a friend started reading a blog I maintained 13(!) 
 years back, and we both regretfully agreed that I was 
 way funnier and profound when I was barely 20 than I am 
 today. Here's to hoping practice makes perfect and 
 some of that mojo maybe captured in time!

One of my goals with a personal site was to not just make 
it a simple blog, or a something that takes too much time either.
Ideally a site that doesn't cost too much money, is still customizable,
 and looks okay despite my abysmal design skills. A year ago,
I stumbled on the site by Noah in reddit, and asked him if I could 
fork his site. He was more than happy with that (thanks Noah!). 

So now we have a (what I think is) slick site powered by gatsbyjs, and uses GitHub Actions to deploy the static site to S3!
Still need to figure out SSL and a publications section, but my primary next goal is to be able to 
 seamlessly push markdown posts from my mobile but that seems tricky for now.

Here's to exciting times!
