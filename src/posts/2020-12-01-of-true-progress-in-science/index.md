excerpt: Thoughts on DeepMind's latest AlphaFold announcement and what it says about academic research today.
---

On Monday, DeepMind (and organizers of the CASP challenge) announced that they have solved protein folding.  [By all measures](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/11/game-has-changed-ai-triumphs-solving-protein-structures), this is a very reasonable exclamation:


    The organizers even worried DeepMind may have been cheating somehow. So Lupas set a special challenge: a membrane protein from a species of archaea, an ancient group of microbes. For 10 years, his research team tried every trick in the book to get an x-ray crystal structure of the protein. “We couldn’t solve it.”

    But AlphaFold had no trouble. It returned a detailed image of a three-part protein with two long helical arms in the middle. The model enabled Lupas and his colleagues to make sense of their x-ray data; within half an hour, they had fit their experimental results to AlphaFold’s predicted structure. “It’s almost perfect,” Lupas says. “They could not possibly have cheated on this. I don’t know how they do it.”


Everyone is eagerly waiting to learn more about this algorithm, to try to recreate it, and see how they can push its boundaries. Most news articles focus on the benefits in drug discovery, but the most exciting outcomes will be in how this can significantly transform basic research - structure prediction for proteins of interest and their variants can become a routine part of lab research, opening new avenues in every single field of questioning.
